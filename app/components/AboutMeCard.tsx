      <p className={styles.text}>
        Product design is more than a career; it&apos;s the result of a lifelong passion for exploration.
        <span className={styles.subText}>
          From building WordPress sites and blogging as a teen, I&apos;ve always been drawn to creating and problem-solving.

        </span>
        This sparked profound interest, leading me to discover the powerful potential of

          product design in solving complex user and business problems.
